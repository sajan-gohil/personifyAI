The winner of the Meta Banner Contest is u/SnooTomatoes7723 and his fanart of the Ear Devil. The devil will be trapped in the bizarre pocket dimension known as our sub's home page for all eternity :DDDD.\n\nI'm really glad with how this contest turned out. Every submission looked amazing and I'm proud to be automatically seeing the artists' posts with a strange motherly concern.\n\nThat's about everything for our 100k celebration, let's continue on to see what happens to Yoru next chapter."

I never banned someone for a legit check post but I might after this post has been up for a while. Please stop.\n\nUse r/legitcheck.

Additionally, I\u2019ve always had trouble with shoes rubbing my ankles. I don\u2019t know why, but every pair I\u2019ve owned has hurt my ankles.

How are the Adidas bounces, ultrabounces, boosts, ultraboosts, pureboosts, alphaboosts, x\\_plr boosts, etc. for my needs? If I have to shortlist a few, which ones should I include in my list (to try out at the store)?\n2. If I can increase my budget, will it make sense to buy Nike Pegasus or Adidas Ultrabounce?\n3.

They mainly sparked my interest because I have a black jumbo that I use frequently as a day bag and I love matching my shoes to my bag. \n\nCan anyone tell me their experience and if they found them to be worth it?\n\nIs there a break in period and do they look good on someone with a height of 5\u20194\u201d? I usually wear shoes more on the pointy side because I am not super tall. Does the rounded tip make anyone feel like it makes them look shorter when already an average height? \n\nHow is wear and tear on these shoes? Is there a lot of maintenance? Some of my more frequently worn shoes I take once or twice a year to the cobbler for maintenance. Wondering if that\u2019s enough to take good care of them to last. \n\nLastly, do you think they go with a more dressy personal style? Lately I see many people wear them with a more casual look such as with denim. I hardly wear denim and my style is generally more dressy (suiting, dresses, etc.). Would it go with my look? \n\nThanks!"
